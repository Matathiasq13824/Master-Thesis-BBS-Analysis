 # Python Machine Learning Training and Analysis

This folder contain all the code used to train the models and analyse their accuracies with the proofs and credentials created by the code present in the `javascript`folder.

To use the various jupyter notebook, you must first install the virtual environment following these commands:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```


- `pre_analysis.ipynb`is used for the analysis of the number of attributes of the driving license credentials, contained in the first file generated by `main.ts`

- `data_cleanup.ipynb`is used for formatting and cleaning the proofs generated by the csv file generated by the third iteration of `main.ts`, to be able to use it for the training of the models.

- `model_training_and_evaluation.ipynb`is used for the training of the models and the recovery of their accuracy.

- `model_data_analysis.ipynb` is used to analyse the accuracy recovered from the models.
